Oxford Nanopore Technologies\\u2019 sequencing devices are unique in their ability to output sequencing data continuously throughout an experiment as soon as reads are complete (and with \", mdx(\"a\", {\n    parentName: \"p\",\n    \"href\": \"https://nanoporetech.com/resource-centre/adaptive-sampling-oxford-nanopore\"\n  }, \"adaptive sampling\"), \", even before reads are complete!). This opens a world of data analysis possibilities, enhanced review of data by users, and opportunities for automated and manual feedback with the sequencer to adapt the experiment on-the-fly for maximum scientific value.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"In this post we have shown how the reactive dataflow paradigm, used in Nextflow to write explicit data processing pipelines, naturally leads to the possiblity of processing data in real-time. With Nextflow we can perform on-line analyses within a standard bioinformatics workflow manager, using standard bioinformatics tooling, without having to resort to writing bespoke data streaming pipelines. Any suitably written Nextflow workflow can be transformed from a batch processing pipeline to a real-time workflow with minimal changes.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"We are particularly excited by the prospect of using sequencing device APIs to amend sequencing parameters dynamically as a result of on-going data analysis orchestrated from within Nextflow. At a simple level this could be changing the targets of an adaptive sampling experiment to supress sequencing of common taxons, or more elaborately to feedback results of an ongoing progressive genome assembly to search for reads overlapping contig ends or poorly resolved graph structures.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Of course we are also intrigued to see what creations the community can create with the
