With Nextflow we can perform on-line analyses within a standard bioinformatics workflow manager, using standard bioinformatics tooling, without having to resort to writing bespoke data streaming pipelines. Any suitably written Nextflow workflow can be transformed from a batch processing pipeline to a real-time workflow with minimal changes.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"We are particularly excited by the prospect of using sequencing device APIs to amend sequencing parameters dynamically as a result of on-going data analysis orchestrated from within Nextflow.
