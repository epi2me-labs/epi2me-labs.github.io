With Nextflow we can perform on-line analyses within a standard bioinformatics workflow manager, using standard bioinformatics tooling, without having to resort to writing bespoke data streaming pipelines. Any suitably written Nextflow workflow can be transformed from a batch processing pipeline to a real-time workflow with minimal changes.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"We are particularly excited by the prospect of using sequencing device APIs to amend sequencing parameters dynamically as a result of on-going data analysis orchestrated from within Nextflow. At a simple level this could be changing the targets of an adaptive sampling experiment to supress sequencing of common taxons, or more elaborately to feedback results of an ongoing progressive genome assembly to search for reads overlapping contig ends or poorly resolved graph structures.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Of course we are also intrigued to see what creations the community can create with the
