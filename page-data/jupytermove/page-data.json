To this\nend we needed a slick, minimal, welcoming presentation of the data analysis. We\nwanted to enable learn the ropes of sequence analysis without being scared by\nit.</p>\n<p>We elected to couple our analysis software with Python notebooks as a first\nstep.  However we felt that the standard JupyterLab interface for Python\nnotebooks was a little too “made by software developers, for software\ndevelopers”, so started to look for alternatives. The Google Colab interface\nfit the bill: it has a clean design with no complex menus, allows code to be\nhidden and contains many nice visual hints as to what is happening when code is\nrun. We therefore built our analysis notebooks and tutorials around the Google\nColab and recommended that it be used with our customised Jupyter notebook\nserver.</p>\n<p>Google Colab is not without its floors however for our purposes. Connecting the\nuser interface to the notebook server is a clunky affair, the interface is\ngeared toward using Google’s cloud compute and storing documents in Google\nDrive. It is also not available for users in some territories.</p>\n<p>To simplify the EPI2MELabs experience for our growing userbase, starting with\nversion 0.2.6 we are recommending that users no longer use the Google Colab\ninterface and instead use the more standard JupyterLab interface included with the\nEPI2MELabs server software. The EPI2MELabs Launcher application has been\nupdated to version 0.6.5 and streamlines the opening of the interface. We will\nno longer be supporting the use of EPI2MELabs with Google Colab.</p>\n<p>But what of the reasons given above for not using JupyterLab from the outset?\nIn the last month we have worked hard to optimise of analysis notebooks and\ntutorials for the JupyterLab interface. This has involved adding additional\nfunctionality to JupyterLab; small user interface tweaks have been made here\nand there to create a more comfortable experience. Of particular note, on\nopening EPI2MELabs in their browser users will now be shown a list of all\navailable analyses and tutorials. When selecting a notebook template a copy\nwill be made an stored on the users computer. It may be edited and saved freely\nwithout fear of irreveribly losing the original template. The users saved\nnotebooks can also be reopened from the launch page providing a convenient\nlocation to start new analyses, or resume old ones.</p>\n<p>This work has not finished: we intend to further enhance the visual display of\ncode within Jupyterlab to provide a more enticing experience for all users.\nThese efforts will be contributed back to the wider Jupter community.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"EPI2MELabs moves to JupyterLab","date":"October 23, 2020","description":"Why were are moving EPI2MELabs to the JupyterLab frontend."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/jupytermove/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/launch/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"EPI2MELabs Blog Launch"}},"next":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["1462070832","240262808","2841359383"]}
