In the first and second case, a sample name can be supplied with `--sample`. In the last case, the data is assumed to be multiplexed with the names of the sub-directories as barcodes. In this case, a sample sheet can be provided with `--sample_sheet`. |  |\\n| bam | string | BAM or unaligned BAM (uBAM) files to use in the analysis. | This accepts one of three cases: (i) the path to a single BAM file; (ii) the path to a top-level directory containing BAM files; (iii) the path to a directory containing one level of sub-directories which in turn contain BAM files. In the first and second case, a sample name can be supplied with `--sample`. In the last case, the data is assumed to be multiplexed with the names of the sub-directories as barcodes. In this case, a sample sheet can be provided with `--sample_sheet`. |  |\\n| classifier | string | Kraken2 or Minimap2 workflow to be used for classification of reads. | Use Kraken2 for fast classification and minimap2 for finer resolution, see Readme for further info. | minimap2 |\\n| analyse_unclassified | boolean | Analyse unclassified reads from input directory. By default the workflow will not process reads in the unclassified directory. | If selected and if the input is a multiplex directory the workflow will also process the unclassified directory. | False |\\n| exclude_host | string | A FASTA or MMI file of the host reference. Reads that align with this reference will be excluded from the analysis. |  |  |\\n\\n\\n### Real Time Analysis Options\\n\\n| Nextflow parameter name  | Type | Description | Help | Default |\\n|--------------------------|------|-------------|------|---------|\\n| real_time | boolean | Enable to continuously watch the input directory for new input files. Reads will be analysed as they appear | This option enables the use of Nextflow\\u2019s directory watching feature to constantly monitor input directories for new files. As soon as files are written by an external process Nextflow will begin analysing these files. The workflow will accumulate data over time to produce an updating report. | False |\\n| batch_size | integer | Maximum number of sequence records to process in a batch. | Large files will be split such that batch_size records are processed together. Set to 0 to avoid rebatching input files. A value of 32000 is recommended to rebatch large files. | 0 |\\n| read_limit | integer | Stop processing data when a particular number of reads have been analysed. By default the workflow will run indefinitely. | Sets the upper bound on the number of reads that will be analysed before the workflow is automatically stopped and no more data is analysed. |  |\\n| port | integer | Network port for communication between Kraken2 server and clients (available in real time  pipeline). | The workflow uses a server process to handle Kraken2 classification requests. This allows the workflow to persist the sequence database in memory throughout the duration of processing. The option specifies the local network port on which the server and clients will communicate. | 8080 |\\n| host | string | Network hostname (or IP address) for communication between Kraken2 server and clients. (See also 'external_kraken2' parameter). (Available in real time  pipeline). | The workflow uses a server process to handle Kraken2 classification requests. This allows the workflow to persist the sequence database in memory throughout the duration of processing. The option specifies the local network hostname (or IP address) of the Kraken server. | localhost |\\n| external_kraken2 | boolean | Whether a pre-existing Kraken2 server should be used, rather than creating one as part of the workflow. (Available in real time  pipeline). | By default the workflow assumes that it is running on a single host computer, and further that it should start its own Kraken2 server. It may be desirable to start a Kraken2 server outside of the workflow, in which case this option should be enabled. This option may be used in conjunction with the `host` option to specify that the Kraken2 server is running on a remote computer.  | False |\\n| server_threads | integer | Number of CPU threads used by the Kraken2 server for classifying reads. (Available in the real_time pipeline). | For the real-time Kraken2 workflow, this is the number of CPU threads used by the Kraken2 server for classifying reads. | 2 |\\n| kraken_clients | integer | Number of clients that can connect at once to the Kraken-server for classifying reads. (Available in the real_time pipeline). | For the real-time Kraken2 workflow, this is the number of clients sending reads to the server. It should not be set to more than 4 fewer than the executor CPU limit. | 2 |\\n\\n\\n### Sample Options\\n\\n| Nextflow parameter name  | Type | Description | Help | Default |\\n|--------------------------|------|-------------|------|---------|\\n| sample_sheet | string | A CSV file used to map barcodes to sample aliases. The sample sheet can be provided when the input data is a directory containing sub-directories with FASTQ files. Disabled in the real time pipeline. | The sample sheet is a CSV file with, minimally, columns named `barcode` , `sample_id`,  `alias`. Extra columns are allowed. A `type` column is required for certain workflows and should have the following values; `test_sample`, `positive_control`, `negative_control`, `no_template_control`. |  |\\n| sample | string | A single sample name for non-multiplexed data. Permissible if passing a single .fastq(.gz) file or directory of .fastq(.gz) files. Disabled in the real time pipeline. |  |  |\\n\\n\\n### Reference Options\\n\\n| Nextflow parameter name  | Type | Description | Help | Default |\\n|--------------------------|------|-------------|------|---------|\\n| database_set | string | Sets the reference, databases and taxonomy datasets that will be used for classifying reads. Choices: ['ncbi_16s_18s','ncbi_16s_18s_28s_ITS', 'SILVA_138_1']. Workflow will require memory available to be slightly higher than the size of the database. | This setting is overridable by providing an explicit taxonomy, database or reference path in the other reference options. | ncbi_16s_18s |\\n| database | string | Not required but can be used to specifically override Kraken2 database [.tar.gz or Directory]. | By default uses database chosen in database_set parameter. |  |\\n| taxonomy | string | Not required but can be used to specifically override taxonomy database. Change the default to use a different taxonomy file  [.tar.gz or directory]. | By default NCBI taxonomy file will be downloaded and used. |  |\\n| reference | string | Override the FASTA reference file selected by the database_set parameter. It can be a FASTA format reference sequence collection or a minimap2 MMI format index. | This option should be used in conjunction with the database parameter to specify a custom database. |  |\\n| ref2taxid | string | Not required but can be used to specify a  ref2taxid mapping. Format is .tsv (refname  taxid), no header row. | By default uses ref2taxid for option chosen in database_set parameter. |  |\\n| taxonomic_rank | string | Returns results at the taxonomic rank chosen.

Concatenate input files and generate per read stats\\n\\n[fastcat](https://github.com/epi2me-labs/fastcat) is used to concatenate input FASTQ files prior to downstream processing of the workflow. It will also output per-read stats including read lengths and average qualities.\\n\\nYou may want to choose which reads are analysed by filtering them using these flags `max_len`, `min_len`, `min_read_qual`, (see the [Inputs section](#advanced-options) for details).\\n\\n### 2. Remove host sequences (optional)\\n\\nWe have included an optional filtering step to remove any host sequences that map (using [Minimap2](https://github.com/lh3/minimap2)) against a provided host reference (e.g. human), which can be a FASTA file or a MMI index. To use this option provide the path to your host reference with the `exclude_host` parameter. The mapped reads are output in a BAM file and excluded from further analysis.\\n\\n\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"nextflow run epi2me-labs/wf-16s \\u2014fastq test_data/case04/reads.fastq.gz \\u2014exclude_host test_data/case04/host.fasta.gz\"), mdx(\"pre\", null, mdx(\"code\", {\n    parentName: \"pre\"\n  }, \"\\n### 3. Classify reads taxonomically\\n\\nThere are two different approaches to taxonomic classification:\\n\\n#### 3.1 Using Minimap2\\n\\n[Minimap2](https://github.com/lh3/minimap2) provides better resolution, but, depending on the reference database used, can take significantly more time. Also, running the workflow with minimap2 does not support real-time analysis. This is the option by default.\\n\\n\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"nextflow run epi2me-labs/wf-16s \\u2014fastq test_data/case01 \\u2014classifier minimap2\"), mdx(\"pre\", null, mdx(\"code\", {\n    parentName: \"pre\"\n  }, \"\\nThe creation of alignment statistics plots can be enabled with the `minimap2_by_reference` flag. Using this option produces a table and scatter plot in the report showing sequencing depth and coverage of each reference. The report also contains a heatmap indicating the sequencing depth over relative genomic coordinates for the references with the highest coverage (references with a mean coverage of less than 1% of the one with the largest value are omitted).\\n\\n#### 3.2 Using Kraken2\\n\\n[Kraken2](https://github.com/DerrickWood/kraken2) provides the fastest method for the taxonomic classification of the reads. Then, [Bracken](https://github.com/jenniferlu717/Bracken) is used to provide an estimate of the species (or the selected taxonomic rank) abundance in the sample.\\n\\n##### 3.2.1 Running wf-16s in real time\\n\\nThe Kraken2 mode can be used in real-time, allowing the workflow to run parallel with an ongoing sequencing run as read data is being produced by the Oxford Nanopore Technologies sequencing instrument. In this case, [Kraken2](https://github.com/DerrickWood/kraken2) is used with the [Kraken2-server](https://github.com/epi2me-labs/kraken2-server) and the user can visualise the classification of reads and species abundances in a real-time updating report.    \\nIn real-time mode, the workflow processes new input files as they become available in batches of the specified size. Thus, this option cannot be used with a single fastq as input.    \\n>Note: When using the workflow in real-time, the workflow will run indefinitely until a user interrupts the program (e.g with `ctrl+c` when on the command line). The workflow can be configured to complete automatically after a set number of reads have been analysed using the `read_limit` variable. Once this threshold has been reached, the program will emit a `STOP.fastq.gz` file into the fastq directory, which will instruct the workflow to complete. The \\\"STOP.fastq.gz\\\" file is then deleted.\\n\\n\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"nextflow run epi2me-labs/wf-16s \\u2014fastq test_data/case01 \\u2014real_time \\u2014batch_size 1000 \\u2014read_limit 4000\"), mdx(\"pre\", null, mdx(\"code\", {\n    parentName: \"pre\"\n  }, \"\\nIf running the Kraken2 pipeline **real_time** in a cluster, there are two options to enable the workflow to be able to communicate with the Kraken-server: \\n\\n1. Run a Kraken-server separately outside of the workflow.\\n2. Submit the workflow job to run on a single node (i.e. running as if on a single local machine).\\n\\n>Notes on CPU resource of Kraken-server and client in the real time workflow\\nThe real-time subworkflow uses a server process to handle Kraken2 classification requests. This allows the workflow to persist the sequence database in memory throughout the duration of processing. There are some parameters that may be worth considering to improve the performance of the workflow:\\n+ port: The option specifies the local network port on which the server and clients will communicate.\\n+ host: Network hostname (or IP address) for communication between Kraken2 server and clients. (See also external_kraken2 parameter).\\n+ external_kraken2: Whether a pre-existing Kraken2 server should be used, rather than creating one as part of the workflow. By default the workflow assumes that it is running on a single host computer, and further that it should start its own Kraken2 server. It may be desirable to start a Kraken2 server outside of the workflow (for example to host a large database), in which case this option should be enabled. This option may be used in conjuction with the host option to specify that the Kraken2 server is running on a remote computer.\\n+ server_threads: Number of CPU threads used by the Kraken2 server for classifying reads.\\n+ kraken_clients: Number of clients that can connect at once to the Kraken-server for classifying reads. It should not be set to more than 4 fewer than the executor CPU limit.\\n\\n### 4. Prepare output\\n\\nThe main output of the wf-16s pipeline is the `wf-16s-report.html` which can be found in the output directory. It contains a summary of read statistics, the taxonomic composition of the sample and some diversity metrics. The results shown in the report can also be customised with several options. For example, you can use `abundance_threshold` to remove all taxa less prevalent than the threshold from the abundance table. When setting this parameter to a natural number, taxa with fewer absolute counts are removed. You can also pass a decimal between 0.0-1.0 to drop taxa of lower relative abundance. Furthermore, `n_taxa_barplot` controls the number of taxa displayed in the bar plot and groups the rest under the category \\u2018Other\\u2019.\\n\\nThe workflow output also contains Kraken and bracken reports for each sample. Additionally, the \\u2018species-abundance.tsv\\u2019 is a table with the counts of the different taxa per sample. You can use the flag `include_kraken2_assignments` to include a per sample TSV file that indicates how each input sequence was classified as well as the taxon that has been assigned to each read. This TSV file will only be output on completion of the workflow and therefore not at all if using the real time option whilst running indefinitely. This option is available in the Kraken2 pipeline.\\n\\n\\n#### 5.1 Diversity indices\\n\\nSpecies diversity refers to the taxonomic composition in a specific microbial community. There are some useful concepts to take into account:\\n* Richness: number of unique taxonomic groups present in the community,\\n* Taxonomic group abundance: number of individuals of a particular taxonomic group present in the community,\\n* Evenness: refers to the equitability of the different taxonomic groups in terms of their abundances.\\n    Two different communities can host the same number of different taxonomic groups (i.e. they have the same richness), but they can have different evenness. For instance, if there is one taxon whose abundance is much larger in one community compared to the other.\\n\\nThere are three types of biodiversity measures described over a special scale <sup>[1](https://doi.org/10.2307/1218190), [2](https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-384719-5.00036-8)</sup>: alpha-, beta-, and gamma-diversity.\\n* Alpha-diversity refers to the richness that occurs within a community given area within a region.\\n* Beta-diversity defined as variation in the identities of species among sites, provides a direct link between biodiversity at local scales (alpha diversity) and the broader regional species pool (gamma diversity).\\n* Gamma-diversity is the total observed richness within an entire region.\\n\\nTo provide a quick overview of the alpha-diversity of the microbial community, we provide some of the most common diversity metrics calculated for a specific taxonomic rank <sup>[3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4224527/)</sup>, which can be chosen by the user with the `taxonomic_rank` parameter ('D'=Domain,'P'=Phylum, 'C'=Class, 'O'=Order, 'F'=Family, 'G'=Genus, 'S'=Species). By default, the rank is 'S' (species-level). Some of the included alpha diversity metrics are:\\n\\n* Shannon Diversity Index (H): Shannon entropy approaches zero if a community is almost entirely made up of a single taxon.\\n\\n```math\\nH = -\\\\sum_{i=1}^{S}p_i*ln(p_i)\\n\")), mdx(\"ul\", null, mdx(\"li\", {\n    parentName: \"ul\"\n  }, \"Simpson\\u2019s Diversity Index (D): The range is from 0 (low diversity) to 1 (high diversity).    \")), mdx(\"pre\", null, mdx(\"code\", {\n    parentName: \"pre\",\n    \"className\": \"language-math\"\n  }, \"D = \\\\sum_{i=1}^{S}p_i^2\\n\")), mdx(\"ul\", null, mdx(\"li\", {\n    parentName: \"ul\"\n  }, \"Pielou Index (J): The values range from 0 (presence of a dominant species) and 1 (maximum evennes).    \")), mdx(\"pre\", null, mdx(\"code\", {\n    parentName: \"pre\",\n    \"className\": \"language-math\"\n  }, \"J = H/ln(S)\\n\")), mdx(\"ul\", null, mdx(\"li\", {\n    parentName: \"ul\"\n  }, \"Berger-Parker dominance index (BP): expresses the proportional importance of the most abundant type, i.e., the ratio of number of individuals of most abundant species to the total number of individuals of all the species in the sample.\")), mdx(\"pre\", null, mdx(\"code\", {\n    parentName: \"pre\",\n    \"className\": \"language-math\"\n  }, \"BP = n_i/N\\n\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"   where n\", mdx(\"sub\", null, \"i\"), \" refers to the counts of the most abundant taxon and N is the total of counts.     \"), mdx(\"ul\", null, mdx(\"li\", {\n    parentName: \"ul\"\n  }, \"Fisher\\u2019s alpha: Fisher (see Fisher, 1943\", mdx(\"sup\", null, mdx(\"a\", {\n    parentName: \"li\",\n    \"href\": \"https://doi.org/10.2307/1411\"\n  }, \"4\")), \") noticed that only a few species tend to be abundant while most are represented by only a few individuals (\\u2018rare biosphere\\u2019).
